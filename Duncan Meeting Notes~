javascript for everything, HTML5
glitchgram- tell you what the GPS time is
Hveto code already available
100s of events is reasonable- wouldn't crash a normal laptop
Different functions for different thresholds
BLRMS useful at C1
Timeseries- hover over points and see value of timeseries
Use matplotlib figure with xml on the top
More fancy- use something other than python
Maybe doesn't have to every data point- could be a fixed amount of points
Could be discretized arbitrarily
Better scheme of storing data points- memory
Learn XML, HTML5, javascript immediately
get slack
